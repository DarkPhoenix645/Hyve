# Hyve
## What is Hyve?
Hyve is a messaging service, cloud storage, management iinterface for a server and a print server with a slick looking web interface all rooled up into one.  
Development of this project was initially for the sole purpose of making my life easier, but as I started making more of time for this particular project of mine, I realised that it can also be a good learning opportunity for me. As a result, you will see not a lot, but still a considerable amount of web frameworks and technologies being used here, all of which are connected in some manner or other.

## Should you use it?
ONLY IF YOU KNOW HOW TO TROUBLESHOOT JAVASCRIPT CODE!!! 
This is so because of the fact that this project is highly integrated into my home's configuration and I decided to make this repository public in order to suppot the open source movement. I have tried my best to make this as modular as possible, but even then you should use it only if you are intrigued by my project (which is highly unlikely). 
At the cost of repeating myself, I should remind you that this is a personal project and no a professional one; also many of the technologies I have used, I'm using them for the first time. 
#### TL;DR : This is not a polished app, use it at your own risk.
